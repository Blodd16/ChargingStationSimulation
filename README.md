## ✨ Features

- 🚗 **Real vehicle animations** — cars drive in, park at charging spots, and leave when done
- ⚡ **Live charging simulation** — battery levels fill up in real time with color indicators
- 🔄 **Dual orientation modes** — switch between **Horizontal** and **Vertical** station layout
- 📊 **Live statistics display** — power output (kW), utilization (%), slots used
- 🟡 **Queue system** — vehicles wait in queue and auto-assign to free spots
- 🎨 **Smooth animations** — cubic ease-in-out transitions for all vehicle movements
- 🌙 **Dark UI theme** — professional dark design with glowing green accents
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform** — runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS via Avalonia UI

### Key Components

#### `AnimatedStationView`
The main animated view with the following capabilities:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ToggleOrientation()` | Switches between Horizontal ↔ Vertical layout |
| `AnimateVehicleDriveIn()` | Smooth cubic ease-in animation for arriving vehicles |
| `AnimateVehicleDriveAway()` | Smooth cubic ease-out animation for departing vehicles |
| `UpdateChargingProgress()` | Animates battery bar fill with color transition |
| `DrawStationLayout()` | Redraws parking spots, arrows, and ports |
| `RedrawAllVehicles()` | Repositions all vehicles after orientation change |

#### `ChargingStation` Model

```csharp
public class ChargingStation
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int Capacity { get; set; }           // Max simultaneous vehicles
    public double CurrentPowerOutput { get; }   // Live kW output
    public double Utilization { get; }          // Usage percentage
    public int QueueLength { get; }             // Waiting vehicles
    public int FreeSlots { get; }               // Available spots
    public List<Vehicle> ChargingVehicles { get; }
}
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Toggle Orientation

Switch the station layout programmatically:

```csharp
// Find the control
var stationView = this.FindControl<AnimatedStationView>("MyStation");

// Toggle between horizontal and vertical
stationView.ToggleOrientation();
```

Or bind a button in XAML:

```xml
<Button Content="🔄 Rotate Layout"
        Click="OnToggleOrientationClick"
        Background="#1ABC9C"
        Foreground="White"
        CornerRadius="8"
        Padding="12,6"/>
```

```csharp
private void OnToggleOrientationClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    StationView.ToggleOrientation();
}
```

### Bind a Station Model

```xml
<views:AnimatedStationView
    x:Name="StationView"
    Station="{Binding MyStation}"
    Width="400"
    Height="500"/>
```

## 🔋 Vehicle States

Each vehicle goes through the following animation states:

```
[OFF SCREEN] ──► ARRIVING ──► CHARGING ──► LEAVING ──► [OFF SCREEN]
                    │                          │
               Drives in                  Drives out
           (ease-in animation)        (ease-out animation)
```

Battery color changes based on charge level:

| Level | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0–30% | 🔴 Red `#E74C3C` | Low battery |
| 30–70% | 🟡 Orange `#F39C12` | Charging |
| 70–100% | 🟢 Green `#1ABC9C` | Full charge |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can tweak simulation constants in `AnimatedStationView.axaml.cs`:

```csharp
// Animation canvas size
private const double CANVAS_WIDTH  = 350;
private const double CANVAS_HEIGHT = 250;

// Vehicle dimensions
private const double VEHICLE_WIDTH  = 60;
private const double VEHICLE_HEIGHT = 30;

// Charging port size
private const double PORT_SIZE = 30;

// Update rate (ms) — lower = smoother animation
Interval = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(50); // 20 FPS
```
